# Sensry Ganymed Sy1xx Bootloader CLI

The Sensry Ganymed SY1xx Bootloader CLI is a command-line tool designed for interfacing with the bootloader of Sensry Ganymed SY1xx series devices. It enables users to flash firmware, update bootloader configurations, and manage device firmware over supported communication interfaces (such as UART, USB, or SPI). The tool is useful for developers working with Sensry Ganymed SY1xx microcontrollers, allowing efficient firmware deployment and maintenance. 

## Installation

```bash
pip install sry-gnm-sy1xx-bl
```

## Usage

```python
import os
from sry_gnm_sy1xx_bl import SryGnmSy1xxBL

# define the file to be uploaded

coreguard_bin = os.path.join("bin", "coreguard-bl.bin")
application_bin = os.path.join("bin", "zephyr_demo_app.bin")

# create the loader

flash = SryGnmSy1xxBL()

# connect to serial

flash.connect("/dev/ttyUSB0")

# convert binary to application ganymed image

application_gnm = flash.convert_zephyr_bin(application_bin)

# set the controller into bootloader mode

flash.enter_loading_mode()

# clear the internal flash

flash.clear_mram()

# write the new binaries

flash.write_mram(coreguard_bin, application_gnm)

print("done")
```
